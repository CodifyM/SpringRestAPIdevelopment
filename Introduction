How to make REST API using springboot


We will create a rest api with the help of spring boot.
This rest api will basically handle the client's request at different https addresses.
We will use POSTMAN for throughing the request i.e. POSTMAN will work as a client.
And, then the server which we will develop via springboot will handle those requests.

Technically via REST API we will handle client request. And, REST API itself is built with the help of springboot.

We will create 4 packages within src/main/java namely:
1. package com.springrest.springrest;
2. package com.springrest.springrest.controller;
3. package com.springrest.springrest.entities;
4. package com.springrest.springrest.services;
